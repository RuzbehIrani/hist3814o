Module 2 Fail Log: This week I had many issues with the module's exercises. Mainly technical ones. First I would like to 
apologize for the late submission I have an exam that I have been studying for plus I am working everyday. 

Exercise 1: Dream Case
This exercise for the most part was simple. I looked at both data-bases and found someone in the CWGC database with the same 
surname and downloaded the contents. What I was not able to do was make a record of it using the nano tet editor. This was 
initially because I could not access DHbox. Everytime I tried to log in it would just refresh the page. I eventually made a
new account. Then there was a problem logging into the command prompt. I asked Nikki (another student in the class) for help 
but she didn't know, so we asked the slack chat and they helped. The second problem with DHbox was when logging into the 
command line. The slack chat helped again with this. The password was just invisible but still there when you typed it in.

Exercise 2: WGET 
This exercise was fairly simple. I can see that many people had the same question about uploading files to github which helped. 

Exercise 3: TEI
This exercise I didn't have too much trouble with. I have saved the xml and xsl files in both my DHbox and Repository. The only
problem  faced was opening the file at the end in the browser. It would not show up. 

I could not complete much this week because of my schedule. I will try my best for next week's exercises.
