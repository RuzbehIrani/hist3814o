Module 3 Fail Log:

This weeks work was a little tough but I completed all the exercises with the help of Matthius and Maggie. 

The first issue I faced was getting the names from the main texas.txt file. I didn't really understand what to select. 
After asking others I was able to scroll down and find what was needed. 

I had some issues opening files in nano but Mattius helped me. 

The next main issue I had was with merging the names in open Refine. I had accidently not selected the "commas" option. 
Maggie pointed this out to me and that helped with the selection of the names to merge. 

This week I was late but I am really happy to have completed both exercises and that I got to learn something useful.
