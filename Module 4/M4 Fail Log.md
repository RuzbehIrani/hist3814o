Module 4 Fail Log

Exercise 1 I was able to complete easily.

Exercise 2 I am having trouble with. The first issue was that I didn't have the content war-diary-text, 
I asked Slack and Dr.Graham sent me a link. The link opens up to a page with a large amount of text. I am not sure how I am 
supposed to use the link sent to me. 

Exercise 3 had issues aswell. When the error message pops up and I have to use the command sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
to download the files, there is an error getting the files in the command line. It reads:
E: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gnutls26/libgnutls-dev_2.12.23-12ubuntu2.5_amd64.deb  404  Not Found [IP: 91
.189.91.23 80]

I am finding it very difficult to move forward with these two exercises. 

I gave exercise 6 a try and it seemed to work out well. I didn't have any issues inserting the URL into Votant.
I find this tool to be very interesting. What I didn't understand in the top right chart was the unit of measurement for the
frequency. It is measure in the fourth decimal place (ex.0.0006).
